Author: Elkana Munganga Due : Friday 11/19/2021 Created: Monday 11/22/2021 Assignment 8

DESCRIPTION:

The goal of the assignment is to have an understanding of recursion and be able to write a program that uses recursion. 

In this case, I have chosen to write a program that has two recursive functions. The first is the fibonacci number sequence, where I used two base cases. The second recursive function is the collatz conjecture. This one uses multiple recursive cases.

Why not recursion instead of iteration?
---
- Fewer lines of code, therefore easy and faster approach to solving these problems and makes it easier to understand.
- Saves us from writing long loops although these are efficient and provide a better time complexity.
 

HOW TO RUN:

First type make clean to remove all the .o files and prog. Then type make. Follow the procedure below to compile and run the program.

Step1: make clean

Step2: make

Step3: type ls to see if all the .o files and prog3 were created. If they exist it means the program works. Then proceed to Step4.

Step4 type prog4 to run the program.

When the program successfully runs:
1. you will receive a message to screen asking you to choose the function that you want to check
2. If you select 1, you will get the fibonacci number sequence
3. If you select 2, you will get the collatz conjecture
4. If no number is selected, the program will quit
